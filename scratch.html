		<h2> Name Assignment</h2>
		<p>  Description: use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked. </p>
		<p> 
		Concepts Learned: Using event blocks green flag clicked, when key pressed. 
		Conditional statements used if statements.
		Used loops used a forever block, used a repeat until block.
		I created my own sprites using the sprite editor, I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the costumes.
		I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked, I rotated the sprites to provide a cool visual. 
		</p>
		<h2> Computer Buying Project</h2>
		<p>Description: With a partner or group we had to interview a family member or friend about what kind of computer they wanted and how much their budget was. We were then to search for different 4 different types of computers under a budget that we thought would best serve the individual interviewed. </p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: In this project I learned how to make objects move smoothly, hide and show sprites, change backdrops, and create speech bubbles. </p>
		<h2> Final Project</h2>
		<p>Description: We were to create a game that had multiple levels, a help screen, kept score, and had a timer. The game had to stop when you won and let you know if you won as well.   </p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: In this project I learned how to make counters and variables, create a gravity system for a sprite, use sensing to determine when a sprite can jump or move, and how to change levels/backgrounds using keys. </p>
