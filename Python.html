		<h2> Python Unit 1</h2>
		<p>Lab 1: This lab was designed to teach us how to use variables and we needed to write a program that takes user input and prints the results of some calculations.</p>
		<p>Lab 2: This lab was supposed to teach us how to use methods. We had to write a program that takes user input for a math trick and prints out the answer.</p>
		<p>Lab 3: This lab teached us how to use classes and methods. We had to write a class that creats and object and moves it around the screen.</p>
		<h2> Python Unit 2</h2>
		<p> Lab 1: This lab was designed to teach you how to use if statements. We had to write a program that would prevent our person from walking off the screen</p>
		<p> Lab 2: This lab tought us how to use If-else statments. We had to write a program that will prevent your person from walking through another object</p>
		<p> Lab 3: This lab was designed to teach us how to use nested if statements. We had to write a program that would allow a character to jump a certain hieght before coming down to the ground</p>
