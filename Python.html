		<h2> Python Unit 1</h2>
		<p>Lab 1: This lab was designed to teach us how to use variables and we needed to write a program that takes user input and prints the results of some calculations.</p>
		<p>Lab 2: This lab was supposed to teach us how to use methods. We had to write a program that takes user input for a math trick and prints out the answer.</p>
		<p>Lab 3: This lab teached us how to use classes and methods. We had to write a class that creats and object and moves it around the screen.</p>
		<h2> Python Unit 2</h2>
		<p> Lab 1: This lab was designed to teach you how to use if statements. We had to write a program that would prevent our person from walking off the screen</p>
		<p> Lab 2: This lab tought us how to use If-else statments. We had to write a program that will prevent your person from walking through another object</p>
		<p> Lab 3: This lab was designed to teach us how to use nested if statements. We had to write a program that would allow a character to jump a certain hieght before coming down to the ground</p>
		<h2> Python Unit 3</h2>
		<p> Lab 1: This lab was designed to teach us how to use loops to repeat code a set number of times. We wrote a program that counts down seconds unitl it reaches 0.</p>
		<p> Lab 2: The goal of this lab was to teach us more about loops, strings, and methods. We had to build a chiper method that recieved 2 parameters. The first being a String parameter and the second states how far to shift the alphabet used to encode the string parameter.</p>
		<p> Lab 3: This lab tought us how to use while loops and variables to draw multiple squares and circles. We had to write a program that would draw shrinking squares and circles.</p>
		<p> Lab 4: This lab tought us to use nested loops. We had to write a program that uses a grass tile to draw the ground and adds rocks at random points on the background.</p>
		<h2> Python Unit 4</h2>
		<p> Lab 1: This lab was designed to teach us how to use lists. We had to write a program that changes a character's image based on the direction it is moving.</p>
		<p> Lab 2: This lab tought us how to use lists, loops, and if statements. We wrote a program that uses different ground tiles to draw the ground.</p>
		<p> Lab 3: This lab showed us how to use lists, loops, and if statements. We had to write a program that used lists to keep track of enemies on the screen.</p>
